Curenimal - “Cure Animal”

Welcome to our compassionate community dedicated to the well-being of our furry friends! 
Curenimal is a project that believes every animal deserves love, care, and a helping hand. The mission is to provide swift and certified treatment to stray and pet animals, ensuring they receive the care they deserve.
The project was initially made as a solution to a problem statement at Google Solution Challenge ‘22. Since then it has been modified in terms of technology, working, and interface.

Features:
User Login System: The project incorporates a secure user login system facilitated by Firebase authentication. Users can sign in using various methods, including Google providers. A popover design ensures a user-friendly login experience.
Help Feature: This feature focuses on delivering prompt and effective treatment to animals in need. Users can report cases, and the system ensures a swift response to address the animals' health concerns.
Hospital Feature: Users can access a list of animal hospitals, enhancing their ability to seek professional care for their pets. (Please note due to the restricted access of actual data as a student, an API providing a list of random hospitals have been used instead. I plan on integrating actual data once the project grows.)
Lost and Found Feature: Users can upload pictures and information about missing pets or report animals found or up for adoption. This data serves as a valuable resource for agencies and NGOs involved in animal welfare.


Structure and Tech-stack:

The project is a comprehensive full-stack application designed to address the needs of stray and pet animals. Leveraging modern web technologies, I have created a user-friendly platform with a range of features to provide prompt treatment, connect users with animal hospitals, and facilitate the process of reuniting lost pets or finding suitable homes through adoption.


Technology Stack:
Frontend Framework: NextJS and React were chosen as the frontend frameworks, offering a robust and efficient development environment.
Backend: Firebase is utilized for both the database and authentication services. Firebase's real-time database ensures quick data retrieval and storage, while the authentication system provides a secure and reliable user login experience.
API Integrations: The project integrates with the Rapid API to fetch real-time data about animal hospitals. This enhances the accuracy and relevance of information provided to users.
UI Component Library: DaisyUI enhances the visual appeal and functionality of the user interface, contributing to a seamless and responsive design.
Programming Languages: Typescript is employed for its static typing, enabling a more structured and scalable codebase. Additionally, JavaScript is used to enhance functionality and interactivity.


Happy helping!!!
